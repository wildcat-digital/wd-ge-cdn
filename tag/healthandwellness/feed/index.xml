										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glucosamine has been used for years to relieve joint pain due to osteoarthritis.

And the industry headlines this week are talking about our latest accomplishment: demonstrating GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup>’s potential for gut health and muscle health.</p>
<h3>What makes you such an expert?</h3>
