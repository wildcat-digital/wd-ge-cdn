										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We at TSI Group, the exclusive manufacturers of GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> vegetal glucosamine are curious about something. We know glucosamine has been around for generations. It is a common supplement taken to relieve joint pain in humans. It can also help companion animals remain active and healthy. But that’s not the curious part.</p>
<h4><strong>What is GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup>?</strong></h4>
<p>GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> is the same ingredient with the same bio-activity as traditional glucosamine. It is just made in a different way. Instead of harvesting the building blocks for the supplement from shellfish, we produce it by processing glucose from non-GMO corn. Same glucosamine, different process to make it. Again, nothing curious about that.</p>
<p>GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> is glucosamine; the magic is in how making it impacts the environment. The process to make GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> reduces waste generation by 98% and reduces the carbon footprint by 80% over shellfish derived glucosamine. But once more, this is not what we are curious about.</p>
<h4><strong>So why are you curious?</strong></h4>
<p>We are curious because we can’t understand why anyone looking to relieve joint pain with glucosamine would ever reach for a product that is made from shellfish. We thought that maybe consumers just don’t know that it is the same supplement. So we checked a number of Google search terms to see what comes up and the one we were most intrigued by was:</p>
<p>“How to get glucosamine naturally”</p>
<p>This is a frequently asked question on Google, and there&#8217;s a good chance this is because people don&#8217;t want to take the supplement knowing that it comes from shellfish. Curiously, almost every link we found from this search contained virtually the same statement: <em>glucosamine occurs naturally in shellfish, otherwise it is made synthetically</em>. Unfortunately this is simply not true. GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> is derived naturally from non-GMO corn via fermentation. That’s it. No shellfish, no extreme waste, no synthesis. But the same glucosamine as always.</p>
<p>So look for the logo and insist on GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> for you and your pet and take care of your health, your pet’s health, and the health of the planet. GlucosaGreen<sup>®</sup> is the Next Generation Glucosamine<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
