										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glucosamine is the most common nutritional supplement taken for joint health and it is widely used around the world. A study by <em>Li </em><em>et al.<sup>【1</sup><sup>】</sup></em>recently looked at the health tracking from 2006 to 2010 of nearly 500,000 people aged 40-70 in the UK. According to the data, 19.1% of the subjects in the study reported regularly taking glucosamine. The results of the study were then corrected for 27 potential contributing factors. These included the understanding that glucosamine users generally have healthier than average lifestyles. With this data the study developed an accurate data model and reported the relationship between regular glucosamine use and reduced mortality.</p>
<h4>What did the study find?</h4>
<p>The study found that regular glucosamine use was significantly associated with a 15% lower risk of mortality from all causes. More specifically it was tied to an 18% reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality, 6% for cancer mortality, 27% for respiratory mortality and 26% for digestive mortality. These findings were reported independent of other potential factors including demographics, lifestyle behaviors, health status, drug use and other supplement use. The results reported by the authors are consistent with other prior epidemiological studies looking at glucosamine and mortality.<sup>【2-4</sup><sup>】</sup>Inspired by this study, <em>Hideya Shintani et al<sup>【</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>】</sup></em>in 2021 suggested that further research should focus on the efficacy of glucosamine in anti-aging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glucosamine with chondroitin is a widely used combination supplement used by many individuals who suffer from osteoarthritis and joint pain. Both glucosamine and chondroitin are natural compounds found in cartilage and are readily available as dietary supplements.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.vitafoodsinsights.com/speciality/glucosamine-chondroitin-may-reduce-overall-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent US study</a>, however indicates that there may be more benefits beyond those for joint health. The study, published by the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (JABFM), sought to investigate the association of daily use of glucosamine/chondroitin with cardiovascular and overall mortality. Results of this indicated that regular supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular related deaths.</p>
