										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too often in the world of supplements we think of certain ingredients as commodities. For these items there are so many options available in the supply chain that determining the best choice often feels like a decision that can only be driven by price. Glucosamine is one of those ingredients. It is widely used to promote joint health, and many human and pet supplement brands have at least one glucosamine SKU. For buyers, finding glucosamine is easy since most distributors handle it, and most will look to get the order based on their ability to meet or beat competitive prices. And these distributors and their customers will agree that glucosamine is a difficult powder to compress. Consequently no matter where it is sourced or how it is processed, turning it into tablets will be a challenge.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem with that kind of thinking in business. Once we say “all (fill in the blank) is the same” we accept the commonly known limitations and then we miss the breakthroughs that could allow us to separate from our competition.</p>
<p>In that spirit we say: don’t miss this breakthrough. TSI has poured decades of experience into developing granules for glucosamine and we have cracked the code to the ideal tablet grade granule. In fact it is truly such a breakthrough that we’ve given the process a name: <em>OptiTab</em> Technology.</p>
<h4>How much do we believe in <em>OptiTab </em>Technology?</h4>
<p>We invite any maker of glucosamine tablets to challenge us to make their exact same product, only better. Measurably better. Better quality, fewer defects, higher yields, and smaller size. It is all possible, and at a cost that ultimately allows our customers to put more profit into their bottom line while <em>making a better product!</em></p>
<p>In the next few weeks we will be officially releasing the TSI Challenge. Take us up on it and put our knowledge to work for you. Then watch as we continue to solve problems you did not even know you had.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A manufacturer recently asked us why they suddenly could only fill their glucosamine capsules to 80% of their weight from previous production runs when the only change was the production lot from the raw material supplier. With the material being in spec they wanted to know: what is the significance of bulk density, tap density, and particle size when encapsulating?</p>
<p>All supplement capsule manufacturers face the same challenges of sourcing raw materials that flow freely while also having the proper density to fit the required dosage into the capsule. Tap density is a good indicator of how a product will respond to the encapsulation process but is not commonly specified by raw material producers. Bulk density however is usually included on a material spec and therefore is used to determine the suitability for encapsulation. Generally speaking, the bulk density and tap density are proportional, and so this works as an adequate indicator on how a product will perform in capsule making – until it doesn’t.</p>
<p>For one thing particle size matters – a larger particle size will generally increase tap density – but so do both particle size <em>distribution</em> and particle <em>shape</em> as well. And these can all vary significantly while the material is still within spec.</p>
<p>The solution? Choose a manufacturer and supplier with decades of experience producing the product from raw material to finished dose and who understands the unique challenges of each dosage form. In this case TSI Group offers a capsule grade glucosamine specifically processed to ensure consistent filling from lot to lot, every time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most successful companies in the supplement industry spend their resources focused obsessively on how to anticipate and meet consumer demands for products that deliver the ingredients they want, in a form that is convenient and easy to take. While these trends have resulted in the growth of soft chews, RTD’s, soft gels, and gummies, the most popular dosage form for glucosamine remains tablets. Tablets allow versatility in combining several active ingredients and can be made to dissolve at a specific rate to allow for maximum efficacy.</p>
<p>As tablet makers strive to separate themselves from the competition, they reach a point where they believe they’ve done all they can to maximize every aspect of their production. So it is with glucosamine, where most suppliers use a spec like particle size distribution and companies assume this is the most effective means of measuring how easily a powder can be compressed into a tablet. They believe that once they have done all they can within these industry standards that there is no more benefit to be gained here. We believe there is much more to be gained by using a granule that is truly compressible, and that can provide tangible gains in tablet size and complexity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US FDA has for several years published recommended guidelines for maximum tablet size for makers of dietary supplements. Though non-binding in nature, these guidelines were developed through extensive research on tablet size and shape, and the ages of individuals taking the supplements. Perhaps not all that surprising is that older adults were more sensitive to tablet size than others<sup>1</sup>. Since glucosamine is typically taken for joint pain and to address the effects of osteoarthritis this is especially relevant to our customers. Keeping to, or exceeding these guidelines offers a competitive advantage for any supplement manufacturer. Companies not only have to make sure their products contain enough active ingredients to deliver the desired dosages, they also have to meet the demand for more diverse and complex matrices in order to keep up with consumer trends.</p>
<p>TSI Group is focused on helping these companies achieve this competitive advantage. We’ve cracked the code on ideal glucosamine granule which can reduce tablet sizes by up to 20% based on the reduced need for binders and excipients. This can be done without compromising tablet hardness and ultimately tablet quality. Full FDA guideline can be found here.</p>
